I'm working in a Go project. Write a function named `GenerateSlug` that takes a string (e.g., "My New Blog Post!") and converts it into a URL-friendly slug (e.g., "my-new-blog-post").

Acceptance Criteria:
1.  It must convert the input string to lowercase.
2.  It must replace all spaces with hyphens.
3.  It must remove any characters that are not lowercase letters, numbers, or hyphens.
4.  Add Go doc comments explaining what the function does, its parameters, and what it returns.

Also, write three distinct table-driven unit tests for this function in a separate `_test.go` file. Cover a standard case, a case with extra spaces, and a case with special characters.
