I have a Node.js application in this directory. The entry point is `server.js`.

Write a complete `Dockerfile` for me.

Requirements:
* Use a slim, official Node.js 20 base image.
* Use a multi-stage build to keep the final image size small.
* The first stage should build the project (`npm install` and any other build steps).
* The final stage should copy only the necessary production dependencies (`node_modules`) and the source code.
* The container should run as a non-root user for security.
* Expose port 3000.
* The final command should be `npm start`.
